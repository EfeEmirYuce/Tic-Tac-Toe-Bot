# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax

This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against an AI using the **Minimax algorithm**. The game features a graphical interface built with `pygame`.

## üéÆ Features

- Human vs AI gameplay
- Smart AI powered by Minimax (plays optimally)
- GUI using `pygame`
- Win/Draw detection
- Game restart support (press **R**)

## üß† AI Method: Minimax

The Minimax algorithm recursively simulates all possible moves to find the optimal strategy. The AI always chooses the move that leads to the best guaranteed outcome, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library

### Installation
```bash
pip install pygame
